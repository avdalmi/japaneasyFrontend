# Japaneasy

During the lockdown period I started a small bento box business. During this time I noticed that not many people know what homecooked Japanese food is outside of sushi, gyozas and karaage. I wanted to help my friends know a little bit more about how special Japan and Japanese food is, so I created this website.
