        Japan has a constitutional monarchy, headed by an emperor. The current
        emperor is Akihito; he wields very little political power, serving
        primarily as the symbolic and diplomatic leader of the country.

        Japanese is in the Japonic language family, and seems to be unrelated to
        Chinese and Korean. However, Japanese has borrowed heavily from Chinese,

        loanwords from Chinese, and 9 percent come from English.

        The native religion of Japan is Shinto, which developed in prehistoric
        times. It is a polytheistic faith, emphasizing the divinity of the
        natural world. Shintoism does not have a holy book or founder. Most
        Japanese Buddhists belong to the Mahayana school, which came to Japan
        from Baekje Korea in the sixth century.

        Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the
        Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago,
        a culture called the Jomon developed. Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned
        fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels. According to

        The first era of recorded history in Japan is the Kofun (A.D. 250-538),
        which was characterized by large burial mounds or tumuli. The Kofun were

        Buddhism came to Japan during the Asuka period, 538-710, as did the
        Chinese writing system. At this time, society was divided into clans.
        The first strong central government developed during the Nara period
        (710-794). The aristocratic class practiced Buddhism and Chinese
        calligraphy, while agricultural villagers followed Shintoism.

      <Paragraph>
        Japan's unique culture developed rapidly during the Heian era
        (794-1185). The imperial court turned out enduring art, poetry, and
        prose. The samurai warrior class developed at this time as well. Samurai
        lords, called "shogun," took over the government in 1185, and ruled
        Japan in the name of the emperor until 1868. The Kamakura Shogunate
        (1185-1333) ruled much of Japan from Kyoto. Aided by two miraculous
        typhoons, the Kamakura repelled attacks by Mongol armadas in 1274 and
        1281.

      <Paragraph>
        A particularly strong emperor, Go-Daigo, tried to overthrow the
        shogunate in 1331, resulting in a civil war between competing northern
        and southern courts that finally ended in 1392. During this time, a
        class of strong regional lords called "daimyo" increased in power; their
        rule lasted through the end of the Edo period, also known as the
        Tokugawa Shogunate, in 1868. That year, a new constitutional monarchy
        was established, headed by the Meiji Emperor. The power of the shoguns
        came to an end. After the Meiji Emperor's death, the emperor's son
        became the Taisho Emperor. His chronic illnesses kept him away from his
        duties and allowed the country's legislature to introduce new democratic
        reforms. During World War I, Japan formalized its rule over Korea and
        seized control of northern China. The Showa Emperor, Hirohito, oversaw
        Japan's aggressive expansion during World War II, its surrender, and its
        rebirth as a modern, industrialized nation.
